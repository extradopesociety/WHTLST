        <h4>I go by the name of Wartortle. I’m the Founder, Artist,Developer, Merch Designer, of the JNKZ Brand. 
          Everything you’ve seen out of this brand is the work of myself, I hope you enjoy!
          
          <h3>JNKZ is a pfp collection filled with 5000 NFTs that'll</h3>
          <h4>1: Make your social pfps look dope af & make all your friends jealous</h4>
          <h4>2: Give you access to limited irl seasonal mech from the JNKZ brand</h4>
          
          <h3>A bit of my background and what I’m looking to accomplish with JNKZ:</h3><h4>I’m branding JNKZ. Like I’m creating a legit brand something you see with Supreme, Ralph Lauren, Louis Vuitton, Vans etc. but for the web3 space specifically on the XRPL. 
          
          I have 10 years experience so far in building a brand, my previous brand is no more but it was 10 years full of trial, error and learning along the way, from learning to graphic design, proper design set up, sizing and positioning. Working with different fabrics to find the right look and feel, and lastly learning the power of mastering simplicity. 
          
          10 years later I’m taking everything I’ve learned and I’m going to be coming out with a fucking bang! 
          
          My focus is holding a limited number of quality products, that come with an experience from the moment of purchase. Starting with the way the merch is purchased, this is where I find a perfect utility with NFTs. NFTs can be a web3 alternative to a receipt, a proof of purchase on the blockchain, with a collectible twist attached to it. I envision NFTs like a receipt and Certificate of Authenticity in one (join the <a href ="http://discord.gg/ZYYMbEkKPs">JKNZ discord</a> for more details on how I will put this into action). 
          
          This merchandise will NOT be 1/1 articles of clothing, that is not the way I want to brand JNKZ. These will be seasonal drops with the same design available in various sizes. The merchandise is in my possession, I don’t and never will go through any of these 3rd party services that print demand, that’s lazy branding imo. Every single article of clothing is held, packaged and shipped by me. To ensure nothing less than a Quality Product and a Quality Presentation.
          
          I’m extremely passionate about this and I hope that comes across the day you receive your JNKZ box in the mail!</h4>
