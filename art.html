        <h4>I have a background in graffiti art, back when I was in school my notebooks were filled with graffiti instead of notes from class. This is why you see it in a lot of my art for example the JNKZ font. 
          The Original JNKZ started out as a doodle of mine from around 2018. I’m a doodler, I’ll get some of my best fonts and art from something that started out on a paper with doodles scribbled all over it.  
          During this time I was running my previous clothing brand. Had the idea of possibly using the now JNKZ character on some clothing, but never got around to it. Now I see its because it wasn’t time. 
          When NFTs started to grow a buzz back in the Beeple days, I really started to take interest in buying and making NFTs on ETH first. I made some 1/1s and 1/10’s it was my first dabble in creating NFTs. 
          Getting to 2021 I started to see these generative 10k collections come out (Punks, BAYC etc.) I knew I could do something like this in my own way. I looked through some of my art and this one specifically 
          spoke generative collection to me. Q3-Q4 2021 I got to work on it, perfected the look, started making different attributes. Before I knew it I had a whole bunch of traits ready to go. At first I was thinking 
          about launching on ETH then literally around the same time I got news that NFTs were coming to the XRPL. XRP is my baby and if NFTs were coming to the XRPL I was there without a doubt. </h4>
          <h3>Boy was I in for a treat.</h3>
          <h4>Fast forward to Jan-Feb 2022 I’m learning what I need to do to get this all generated together. I have beginner level experience in javascript so I can somewhat understand what I’m looking at in code, but I can’t pull something out of my ass and code something from scratch if you know what I mean. It worked but it still needed to be perfected. Getting eyes to match with the face, getting girl attributes to only appear with girl attributes, and boy attributes to go with boy. 
          By March I figured out how to get JNKZ generated properly and was ready to start getting the word out there. Once the generated art started coming together I saw how much of myself and my personal style I put into the artwork and I knew this is what I wanted to run with long term for JNKZ.</h4>
